Goals
_____

* Child Window: OpenGL window as a child window so it can embedded into
                an application.
* Open Context handling: Allows multiple OpenGL instances.
* OpenGL Material handling: Wrappers that make dealing with OpenGL materials
                            easier to do.
* Movement/positioning: Built in mouse control that makes sense. 
* Object containers: Objects are the things being rendered. This can be an entire 
                     scene or a single piece where groups would make up a scene.
* Object selection: Ability to select an object
