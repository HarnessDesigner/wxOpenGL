# wxOpenGL
wxPython OpenGL framework

This project aims to make it easier to use OpenGL from Python using the wsPython 
cross platform GUI framework.

***WARNING***: Still in development

Goals
_____

* ✅️ Child Window: OpenGL window as a child window so it can embedded into
                an application.
* ✅️️ OpenGL Context handling: Allows multiple OpenGL instances.
* ✅️ OpenGL Material handling: Wrappers that make dealing with OpenGL materials
                            easier to do.
* ⬜️ Movement/positioning: Built in mouse control that makes sense. 
* ✅️ Object containers: Objects are the things being rendered. This can be an entire 
                     scene or a single piece where groups would make up a scene.
* ✅️ Object selection: Ability to select an object
